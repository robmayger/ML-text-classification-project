# ML Text Classification Project

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for text classification tasks using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment components.

## Features

- Modular codebase organized within the `src/` directory.
- Support for training and evaluating various classification models.
- Dockerized environment for consistent setup and deployment.
- Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping. ([all kinds of text classification models and more with deep learning](https://github.com/brightmart/text_classification?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robmayger/ML-text-classification-project.git
   cd ML-text-classification-project
   ```


2. **Build and run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```


   This will set up the development environment and install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Access the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Once the container is running, you can access the Jupyter Notebook interface at `http://localhost:8888`.

## Usage

- Use the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.
- The `src/` directory contains modules for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Modify the scripts as needed to suit your specific text classification tasks. ([Pretrained Models For Text Classification - Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/03/6-pretrained-models-text-classification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
